# Brick Wobbling Simulator
## Introduction
It's clear: the world loves bricks. We make 1.5 trillion of them every year, for building houses, laying pavements, and most importantly, wobbling. Brick wobbling is consistently voted the world's most popular hobby, with over 2 people enjoying it each day.

But brick production is also a disaster for the environment. Last year it consumed 375 million tonnes of coal, and it accounted for 25% of the total energy usage in the construction materials sector. With global temperatures soaring to record highs, it's clear we have to find a more sustainable way to wobble bricks.

That's why I made **Brick Wobbling Simulator**. With BWS, you can wobble bricks for free, from anywhere in the world, in the most carbon-efficient way available. You can start wobbling right now on [this page](index.html), or you can read on to learn about all the exciting features BWS has to offer.

Happy wobbling!
